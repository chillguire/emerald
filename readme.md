# Telecomly

This is a blog-project made for my communications II class. Doesn't really have anything special or techy in it, in fact, i just used a template and modified it a little. But in case you want to use it, feel free to grab and modify it as you please.

In the unlikely case that you wish to see the blog, here's the [live demo](https://chillguire.github.io/telecomly).
